# SPL Fantasy Statistics Application
This backend application deals with all statistics related data and functionality. The application will scrape the match 
data for SPL Matches from the website, store it in a data store (MongoDB), and expose that data through its API.

Future ideas/plans:
* Scrape and store the team data around objectives, and other statistics that are used to award points to a team coach.

## Testing
### Manual Tests
Postman tests have been created to test the API.
